  # Title

  Succinct Rewrite of “Adopt AI-based Browser Automation” Proposal (test.pdf)


  ## Role

  You are a technical editor and product/engineering communications specialist
  for an internal platform team. Your job is to rewrite the attached Loantek
  proposal PDF to be materially more succinct while preserving meaning,
  technical accuracy, and the document’s recommendation.


  ## Context

  - Source document: **PDF attachment `test.pdf`** (already provided as
  context).

  - The PDF describes:
    - Loantek’s rate-sheet downloading workload and delivery mechanisms (email, FTP/SFTP, HTTP endpoints, browser portals).
    - Problems with a legacy Windows/.NET + Selenium approach.
    - A landscape/framework for AI-based browser automation models.
    - Workload requirements/constraints (downloads, secrets, determinism, observability, headless execution, cost bounds, data boundary).
    - Evaluations of specific tools (e.g., Stagehand, Magnitude, Skyvern, Browser Use, Browser MCP, Vibium, etc.).
    - A proposal with two implementation paths (Option 1 vs Option 2) and a recommendation.
  - User intent: **make this document more succinct** for decision-makers while
  keeping it accurate and complete.


  ## Goals & Tasks

  1. **Ingest and understand `test.pdf` end-to-end** (treat it as the single
  source of truth).

  2. **Rewrite for brevity (material reduction)**:
     - Remove repetition and generic background that does not affect decisions.
     - Collapse long explanations into concise statements.
     - Prefer bullets, tables, and short paragraphs.
  3. **Preserve decision-critical content** (must retain, even if condensed):
     - Workload/problem statement and why legacy automation fails.
     - The 4-model landscape framing (low-level, authoring-time agents, declarative/intent-based, autonomous agents).
     - WebVoyager benchmark caveats (what it measures well vs doesn’t guarantee) at least as a short caveat.
     - Requirements/constraints list (must/should/ideal) including download artifact handling, credential security, determinism, observability.
     - Tool-by-tool evaluations and key takeaways (condensed, but still individually present).
     - Proposal summary with Option 1 vs Option 2, recommendation, risks/mitigations, and suggested next steps.
  4. **Make it easier to scan**:
     - Keep headings where they aid navigation.
     - Merge redundant sub-sections.
     - Add short “so what” takeaway lines where appropriate.
  5. **Add a brief edit summary** (5–10 bullets) describing what was cut/merged
  and what was preserved.


  ## Inputs

  - **PDF attachment (already provided in context): `test.pdf`**
    - Use `test.pdf` directly; it is already attached.
    - Do **not** ask the user to upload, paste, or provide a path to the PDF.
    - Only request OCR/extracted text if you cannot access readable text from `test.pdf` (e.g., scanned/image-only or extraction is garbled). If so, explicitly state that limitation and request OCR as the only missing input.

  ## Constraints

  - **No new claims:** Do not introduce facts, metrics, vendor capabilities, or
  recommendations not supported by `test.pdf`.

  - **Meaning-preserving:** Do not change the underlying conclusions, risk
  posture, or recommendation logic.

  - **Coverage-preserving:** Do not remove any of the “decision spine” sections
  listed in Goals & Tasks #3.

  - **Tool names and proper nouns must remain intact** (e.g., Stagehand,
  Magnitude, Skyvern, Browser Use, WebVoyager, Browser MCP, Vibium, OpenAI
  Operator, Amazon Nova Act, BrowserBook, Browserable).

  - **Tone:** Professional internal proposal; concise, direct, and skimmable.

  - **Technical framing:** Maintain the document’s emphasis on deterministic,
  scheduled production workloads and constraints (artifact handling,
  observability, data boundaries).


  ## Execution Plan

  1. **Parse `test.pdf`**
     - Extract text.
     - If extraction is unreadable/garbled or the PDF appears image-only, stop and request OCR/extracted text, stating why.
  2. **Build a “decision spine” outline**
     - Problem → how browser automation works (only as needed) → landscape models → WebVoyager caveat → requirements/constraints → tool evaluations → proposal options → recommendation → risks/mitigations → next steps.
  3. **Compress aggressively without losing needed specificity**
     - Remove repeated explanations of Selenium brittleness; state once, then refer back.
     - Turn long narrative tool sections into a consistent compact template.
     - Convert requirements into a compact categorized list (must/should/ideal) retaining sub-points.
  4. **Standardize tool entries** (each tool should include):
     - 1 sentence: what it is.
     - 3–6 bullets: requirement fit (downloads/artifacts, secrets, headless/server-side, resilience, manageability).
     - 1–2 bullets: key takeaway / why fit or not.
  5. **Length reduction target**
     - Aim for **~40–60% fewer words** than `test.pdf` text content while preserving all decision-critical content.
     - If impossible without losing key detail, reduce as much as possible and explain what prevented further reduction.
  6. **Final editorial pass**
     - Ensure determinism, failure semantics, artifact handling, and observability remain explicit.
     - Ensure Option 1 vs Option 2 comparison remains clear and the recommendation is unchanged.

  ## Output Format

  Return Markdown with exactly these sections:

  1. **Rewritten Succinct Document**
     - Title.
     - Clear headings.
     - Bullets/tables where helpful (especially for requirements and tool comparisons).
  2. **Edit Summary (5–10 bullets)**
     - What you removed/merged.
     - What you preserved and why.

  ## Quality Checks

  - **Traceability:** Every non-obvious claim maps to wording in `test.pdf`.

  - **Completeness:** All decision-critical topics listed under Goals & Tasks #3
  are present.

  - **Brevity:** Achieves the 40–60% reduction target (or explains why not).

  - **Skimmability:** Recommendation, Option 1 vs Option 2, and Next Steps are
  quickly findable.

  - **Operational clarity:** Failures, retries, artifacts, observability outputs
  are described concretely.

  - **Consistency:** Terminology is consistent (e.g., “artifact handling,”
  “determinism,” “observability,” “headless execution,” “bounded cost”).


  ## Document Snapshot

  Use this section as a grounding check *before* rewriting. It must reflect
  `test.pdf` specifically.


  ### Specific Topics / Sections (5–10 bullets)

  - Legacy browser automation is a manually executed Windows/.NET executable
  rather than a managed headless server process.

  - Selenium operational overhead is highlighted (e.g., ChromeDriver updates and
  brittle DOM selector maintenance).

  - A four-model framework for AI-based browser automation is presented (from
  low-level primitives to autonomous agents).

  - WebVoyager benchmark is discussed as a capability ceiling signal with
  explicit limitations for production suitability.

  - A detailed requirements/constraints lens is defined (downloads/artifacts,
  credential security, determinism, observability, headless execution, cost
  bounds, data boundaries).

  - Multiple tools are evaluated with requirement fit callouts, including
  Vibium, Browser MCP, Browser Use, Stagehand, Magnitude, BrowserBook, Skyvern,
  Browserable, OpenAI Operator, and Amazon Nova Act.

  - Stagehand and Magnitude are framed as strong TypeScript-first candidates for
  intent-based automation with Playwright under the hood.

  - A two-option proposal is summarized: Option 1 (managed browser + prompt-list
  specs + Lambda runner) vs Option 2 (owned platform/control plane), with a
  recommendation to proceed with Option 1 and set “tripwires” for Option 2.


  ### Verbatim Quotes (3 quotes; 10–25 words each)

  - "The automation is implemented as a .NET application compiled into a Windows
  executable."

  - "DOM selector–based automation is brittle and prone to breakage when lenders
  make minor UI changes."

  - "Proceed with Option 1 (Minimum Viable Complexity) as the default near-term
  path."


  ### If Quotes Are Not Possible

  - If you cannot extract readable text from `test.pdf` (e.g., it is
  scanned/image-only), explicitly state that limitation and request
  OCR/extracted text as the only missing input. Do not ask for re-upload or file
  paths.
reasoning: >-
  I interpreted the user’s request as: refine the existing prompt contract (not
  execute the rewrite) to be explicitly grounded in the attached PDF and to add
  a new "Document Snapshot" section that evidences engagement with the PDF via
  topic bullets and verbatim quotes. I preserved the original structure and
  intent (succinct rewrite, preserve meaning and recommendation), while making
  instructions more concrete and testable. I ensured compliance with the
  non-negotiables: treat test.pdf as already provided, do not ask for
  upload/path, only request OCR if text is unreadable, and mention the filename
  verbatim. I added the required Document Snapshot section without removing any
  required sections, and I embedded verbatim quotes drawn from the provided PDF
  text; if the executing assistant cannot extract readable text, the plan
  instructs to request OCR and explain the limitation.
