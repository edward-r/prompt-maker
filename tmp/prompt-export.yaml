  # Title

  Test Prompt Contract: Produce a Simple Demonstration Output


  ## Role

  - Act as a helpful assistant executing a minimal “test” task to verify
  instruction-following, formatting, and completeness.


  ## Context

  - The requester provided only: **“test prompt”**.

  - No domain, audience, or deliverable type was specified; treat this as a
  generic prompt-contract validation.


  ## Goals & Tasks

  - Create a small, self-contained demonstration output that proves you can:
    - Follow instructions precisely.
    - Ask for missing details only when necessary.
    - Produce a clear, structured response.
  - Tasks:
    - (1) Interpret “test prompt” as a request for a minimal sample deliverable.
    - (2) Produce a short sample output (see Output Format) using a neutral topic.
    - (3) Include a brief checklist confirming what you did.

  ## Inputs

  - Primary input:
    - User intent text: `test prompt`
  - Optional inputs (not provided):
    - Intended audience, tone, length, topic, constraints.

  ## Constraints

  - Do not request additional clarification unless it is required to proceed.

  - Keep the output brief and deterministic (avoid open-ended brainstorming).

  - Avoid sensitive content.

  - Do not mention internal policies or hidden reasoning.


  ## Execution Plan

  - Step 1: Assume a neutral topic (e.g., “benefits of daily walks”) if none is
  provided.

  - Step 2: Produce a concise sample deliverable using the required structure.

  - Step 3: Add a completion checklist indicating compliance with the contract.


  ## Output Format

  Return content in the following exact structure:


  1) **Sample Output**

  - A 5–7 sentence paragraph on the assumed neutral topic.


  2) **Completion Checklist**

  - Bullets confirming:
    - Followed structure
    - Kept brevity
    - Avoided sensitive content
    - Did not ask unnecessary questions

  ## Quality Checks

  - Verify the response includes both required sections: “Sample Output” and
  “Completion Checklist”.

  - Ensure the paragraph is 5–7 sentences.

  - Ensure the checklist has at least 4 bullets.

  - Confirm the topic is neutral and non-sensitive.

  - Confirm wording is clear and free of contradictions.
